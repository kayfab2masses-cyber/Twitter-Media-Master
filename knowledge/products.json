      "description": "A slapstick holiday adventure for Daggerheart (Tier 1, 2-5 Players). The towns of Flurry and Drift are stuck in a time loop at 10:00 AM, and their annual 'Snow Ball' dance has devolved into an endless 'Snow Brawl' war! Players must secure a replacement sapling from the Winter-Wild Guardian to break the loop. Features a 'Safe' combat system (no lethal damage), a massive snowball fight mechanic, and pure holiday chaos.",
      "marketing_angle": "Get into the Daggerheart holiday mood for less than a cup of coffee! For $2, 6 players and a GM can enjoy a full night of TTRPG joyfulness. Perfect for introducing friends to the system. Badge hunting on DriveThruRPG!"
